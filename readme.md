![cover.png](cover.png)

## About
**Enchantment Lore Extended** is a resource pack intended to be used with [Enchantment Lore](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-lore), which allows the player to "read" enchanted books as if they're actual books.

This pack adds descriptions and flavor text for the enchantments in the mod/datapack [BeyondEnchant](https://modrinth.com/datapack/beyondenchant) and [Neo Enchant+](https://modrinth.com/datapack/neoenchant) made by [Hardel](https://modrinth.com/user/Hardel-DW). The lore is tied in with [Yggdrasil](https://modrinth.com/datapack/yggdrasil-structure) made by the same author.

This pack features formatted text showcasing a stylized title, applicable items, maximum level, a brief description, and any incompatibilities. Flavor text or lore is added at the end of each enchantment, viewable directly in-game.

## Preview
